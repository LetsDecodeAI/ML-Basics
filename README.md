# 🧠 ML Basics - Lets Decode AI

Welcome to the official repository for **Lets Decode AI**! 

This repository is dedicated to stripping away the complexity of Machine Learning libraries (like Scikit-Learn) and building algorithms **from scratch** to understand the underlying mathematics and logic.

## 📺 About This Repository
In this repo, we don't just call `model.fit()`. We build the `fit()` function ourselves. 
The goal is to bridge the gap between Theoretical Math and Practical Python Code.
